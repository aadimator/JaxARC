# Point-Based Action Configuration

# Selection Settings
selection_threshold: 0.5 # Not applicable for point actions but kept for consistency
allow_partial_selection: false # Point actions are always single-cell selections

# Operation Settings
num_operations: 50 # Number of available operations
allowed_operations: null # Allow all operations (null means no restriction)

# Validation Settings
validate_actions: true # Validate point coordinates and operations
clip_invalid_actions: true # Clip invalid coordinates to grid bounds

# Point-specific Settings
allow_out_of_bounds: false # Whether to allow points outside grid bounds
