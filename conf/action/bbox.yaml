# Bbox-Based Action Configuration
# This configuration defines bbox-based action space for ARC tasks
# Actions consist of selecting a rectangular region and applying an operation

# Action Format
selection_format: "bbox" # Use bbox-based actions (row1, col1, row2, col2) + operation

# Selection Settings
selection_threshold: 0.5 # Not applicable for bbox actions but kept for consistency
allow_partial_selection: false # Bbox actions are always rectangular selections

# Operation Settings
num_operations: 50 # Number of available operations
allowed_operations: null # Allow all operations (null means no restriction)

# Validation Settings
validate_actions: true # Validate bbox coordinates and operations
clip_invalid_actions: true # Clip invalid coordinates to grid bounds

# Bbox-specific Settings
allow_out_of_bounds: false # Whether to allow bbox coordinates outside grid bounds
min_bbox_size: 1 # Minimum size for bbox dimensions (width and height)
max_bbox_size: null # Maximum size for bbox dimensions (null means no limit)
allow_empty_bbox: false # Whether to allow empty bounding boxes
